## About this book

The book covers different aspects of Data Engineering, from basic topics like databases, SQL and ETL to advanced like data architecture and Big Data stacks.

But it is still under development. It has no strict set of topics I want to cover, but it will be pretty close to what I've described in my [Data Engineering Roadmap](/book/1-introduction-to-data-engineering/1.2-data-engineering-roadmap.md).

## How to read this Book

If you are an absolute novice – start with [introduction to Data Engineering](./book/1-introduction-to-data-engineering/1.1-what-is-data-engineering.md). I will explain who are data engineers, what tasks they perform, which skill are required etc.

If you already decided to learn data engineering, but don't know where to start – head on to the [Data Engineering roadmap](./book/1-introduction-to-data-engineering/1.2-data-engineering-roadmap.md). There I show three paths you can take, from absolute beginner to advanced levels.

Lastly, if you know what exactly you want to learn then head to the [table of content](#table-of-content) down below and find the most interesting topics for you.

- `2021-03-02`: Added "SQL for beginners"
- `2021-01-10`: Added [Intro to databases](./book/2-beginner-path/2-1-databases/databases.md)
